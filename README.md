# Rhymebook

## Project Overview
Rhymebook is a lyric writing application that gives suggested follow ups to the user's input. The suggested terms can be swayed by adding up to 5 words to the themes section (seperated by commas or spaces) and choosing whether to use the broad or specific search engine. You can define the max number of queries returned for each individual category with the slider.
